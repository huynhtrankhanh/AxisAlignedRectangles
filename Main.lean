A simple structure to represent an axis-aligned rectangle in a 2D plane.
Here, (x1, x2) are the minimum and maximum x-coordinates of the rectangle,
and (y1, y2) are the minimum and maximum y-coordinates.

Predicate stating that two rectangles are "line-aligned":  
there is a line parallel to the x-axis or y-axis that intersects both
rectangles in a non-empty line segment.

  -- They align horizontally (their y-intervals overlap) 
  -- OR they align vertically (their x-intervals overlap).

The main theorem: If every pair of rectangles in G is line-aligned,
then there exist a horizontal line and a vertical line that each intersect 
every rectangle in G.
